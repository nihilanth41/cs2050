WARNING to whoever grades this, it will loop forever on to_postfix() so you may want to breakpoint there and step through if you want to run it. 

FWIW I had a lot of trouble with the to_postfix() function and I am hoping we can go over it or at least see an example. 

Also I wasn't sure if we were supposed to re-implement main() and eval() or just use the ones given.
