Hello,
You should be able to easily parse this file and pull out important information such as this phone number (612)-570-9432 but not this one (314)578-1642. Your program should also be able to handle dates like 04/16/1964 because that day really happened but not 02/31/2011 as it unfortuantly did not. Good luck on this assignment and if you have any trouble please send me an email at seth@gmail.com (or if you can manage the bonus* seth@missouri.edu *). 

Sincerly,
Seth Wiesman
